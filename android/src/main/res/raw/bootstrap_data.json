        "description": "As Square has grown from a tiny startup to a large brand, I am leading our effort to maintain Squares high quality software releases for Register.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our latest campaign has to deal with automation testing. Delivering a solution that executes a matrix of tests over a matrix of devices with different configurations (screen sizes, cpus, android OS versions and so on).<br /><br />- Making it easy for our team to write new tests and understand existing ones<br />- Reduction of manual testing<br />- Decrease in regressions and gaining confidence<br />- Localization via screenshots (while tests are running)<br />- Custom \"Variations\" that provide execution of tests with different parameters (similar to Parameterized tests but tailored for Square)<br />- Dealing with flakiness in tests and how to write good automated tests (we are using Espresso)<br />- Team culture for writing tests<br /><br />I am the tech lead behind both Android and iOS, I will be focusing mostly on Android but a few examples can be provided for comparison with iOS.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are tackling this problem head on. We've tried in the past but we feel like we are now succeeding in realizing our goals.<br /><br />My talk is about brand and quality, how both interconnect and how my primary goal at Square is to have our Register app running reliably for all our customers. Payments has a few intricacies and our team must remain disciplined.",

Developers need better tools now, more than ever, and the number of third-party SDKs is also growing to meet the developer's needs. Unfortunately, many of these SDKs are poorly developed and extremely difficult to use. In fact, at Twitter on the Crashlytics team, we've detected a significant percentage of issues caused by third-party SDKs.<br /><br />Crashlytics is well-known for its focus on SDK quality, and have been deployed on hundreds of millions of devices. In this session, attendees will learn the skills to develop and distribute SDKs for Android. We'll explore how to design and build an SDK for stability, testability, performance, overall footprint size, and, most importantly, exceptional ease of implementation. Over the course of the session, we'll develop a simple but well-architected SDK and uncover and explain many of the challenges we encountered when building SDKs at Twitter. Topics include device feature detection, supporting multiple application types (from Widgets to Services to Foreground GUI applications), API design, deploying artifacts, and coding patterns to support developer customization. We'll conclude with advanced topics, from less-known but very useful tricks to minimizing impact on application start-up time to reducing memory footprint and persistent CPU use.",

In this talk, we'll discuss some the changes we made to the Facebook app that resulted in 65% data usage improvements and 50% efficiency gains over about a 6 month period.&nbsp;<br /><br />While these gains were mostly general efficiency improvements that benefited all of of our users, for the second phase of the project we&rsquo;ve been working on more targeted optimizations. These improvements could be optimized based on type of device, network connection characteristics, or general usage patterns of the app. We&rsquo;ll delve into some of the details of the system, including an overview of our innovative device- and network-classification technologies, a new configuration system that powers this optimization, and a discussion of our \"smart prefetching\" technologies.&nbsp;<br /><br />The last thing we'll cover is how we improved the speed and performance of Instagram for Android, and share some of the methods we use to maintain a fast and reliable experience.",

Hoping to build on that talk and go a bit more indepth into how to actually implement a custom drawable. What is a Drawable? How do you make one? How do they interact with their Views. Lisa&rsquo;s got a few stories to share about writing a custom Drawable type from scratch. Do you know the difference between getMinimumHeight vs getIntrinsicHeight, and more importantly why making custom Drawables is painful. We&rsquo;ll talk about the native Drawable types, how custom Drawables can be included in XML (hint, they can&rsquo;t), the nuts and bolts of how Drawable instances share their constant state (So why bitmap images for Drawables get shared). Finally, we&rsquo;ll go into the relationship between views and drawables -- how do drawables&rsquo; size get set, and what&rsquo;s the difference between using a ColorDrawable versus a BitmapDrawable with respect to the View that is using the Drawable as a view backing.",

Most hobbyist electronics projects today use the smartphone as an interacting interface via some kind of wireless connection.<br />relayr created the WunderBar to enable app developers to quickly apps with physical components. But an unexpected outcome was to see hardware tinkerers become app developers, because their projects need an app.<br /><br />In this talk I will showcase my own story of how I developed an Android App for a gadget used to help keep my insulin safe. most of the talk is about the overlap app/device and best practives to produce an Android-compatible BLE gadget.",

The Geographic Approach provides a new way of thinking about problem solving by including geographic information, e.g. Location services, geofencing, geocoding, etc. Leveraging some of the core Android technologies like the Android location framework classes which define location based services on Android we can show how the Geographic Approach helps mobile workers make decisions.&nbsp;<br /><br />We can't always be within service range, so being able to take your data offline and continue to be able to work with it is an important part of the mobile ecosystem. We will look at ways to continue to work with your data offline to extend the Geographic Approach.",
