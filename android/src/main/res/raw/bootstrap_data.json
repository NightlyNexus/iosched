Developers need better tools now, more than ever, and the number of third-party SDKs is also growing to meet the developer's needs. Unfortunately, many of these SDKs are poorly developed and extremely difficult to use. In fact, at Twitter on the Crashlytics team, we've detected a significant percentage of issues caused by third-party SDKs.<br /><br />Crashlytics is well-known for its focus on SDK quality, and have been deployed on hundreds of millions of devices. In this session, attendees will learn the skills to develop and distribute SDKs for Android. We'll explore how to design and build an SDK for stability, testability, performance, overall footprint size, and, most importantly, exceptional ease of implementation. Over the course of the session, we'll develop a simple but well-architected SDK and uncover and explain many of the challenges we encountered when building SDKs at Twitter. Topics include device feature detection, supporting multiple application types (from Widgets to Services to Foreground GUI applications), API design, deploying artifacts, and coding patterns to support developer customization. We'll conclude with advanced topics, from less-known but very useful tricks to minimizing impact on application start-up time to reducing memory footprint and persistent CPU use.","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356612/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4Poie","startTimestamp":"2014-09-20T19:30:00Z","title":"Building First Class Android SDKs","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-20T20:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5521","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP","TOPIC_ADVANCED","TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE"],"color":null,"mainTag":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","room":"c6bbd6c8"},{"speakers":["0f4d06f5-a971-4c5d-bf56-66efaf37cada"],"description":"A deep dive into what the Android internals consist of for both of these wearable device platforms.

And I'll give advice on which libraries to use to make good networking easy.","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356581/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4Pmqw","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T17:30:00Z","title":"HTTP in a hostile world","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T18:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5548","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP","TOPIC_ADVANCED"],"color":null,"mainTag":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","room":"e16ec9a4"},{"speakers":["e9af7ffa-2543-448f-91c6-bd2d4a6f4276"],"description":"I have been working on Vine for Android's video framework in the last 18 months, wanna share all the experience and things I learned on Android's video playback and recording capabilities. #MediaPlayer #MediaRecorder #MediaCodec, #ExoPlayer, #TextureView, #FrameRecording, #Camera","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356604/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4QlH5","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T17:30:00Z","title":"Playing and Recording Videos","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T18:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5549","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP","TOPIC_ADVANCED","TOPIC_VIDEO"],"color":null,"mainTag":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","room":"5faad506"},{"speakers":[],"description":null,"photoUrl":"","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4QiuS","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T17:30:00Z","title":"Topps","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T18:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5800","tags":["THEME_BUSINESS"],"color":"#666666","room":"c6bbd6c8"},{"speakers":["bd15afc9-6206-451a-bff3-bb5cec2affb1"],"description":"A detailed discussion of how Square uses its open source libraries Dagger, Flow and Mortar to build its apps and enjoy the process.","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356596/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4QlqP","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T17:30:00Z","title":"Under Square's Hood","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T18:10:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5801","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP","TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE"],"color":null,"mainTag":"TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE","room":"accf3d0c"},{"speakers":["c9981173-759d-4156-bfe3-aed801c5f797"],"description":"While Android already provides easy and quick access to the existing camera application on a user's device, to fully integrate the camera into your application and user experience, to add your own custom filters and processing, to control the format and persistence of media, or to fully leverage new and advanced features such as metering and face detection, you may find yourself wanting to build a custom camera application.<br /><br />This session is for developers with Android experience (intermediate level and above) but who may not be familiar with the Camera API. During the session, we will run through an example of building a custom camera from scratch, from the basics of retrieving camera permissions and features, to properly controlling and working with the flow of the Camera class, to laying out and displaying camera previews, and finally accessing camera features. We will also talk about common issues you may encounter and other considerations to keep in mind while building a custom camera.","photoUrl":"http://static.sched.org/a4/1356594/avatar.jpg","url":"http://bit.ly/1w4Qj22","startTimestamp":"2014-09-21T18:20:00Z","title":"Building Custom Camera Applications","youtubeUrl":"","endTimestamp":"2014-09-21T19:00:00Z","hashtag":"androidnyc","isLivestream":false,"captionsUrl":"","id":"5802","tags":["THEME_DEVELOP"],"color":"#666666","room":"accf3d0c"}],"video_library":[],"hashtags":[{"color":"#303f9f","order":1,"name":"#androidnyc","description":"Android NYC is cool"},{"color":"#80cbc4","order":15,"name":"#androidnyc #Jamaoke","description":"Chat about the party"}],"experts":[],"rooms":[{"original_id":"c6bbd6c8-20f4-4715-87da-23ab00b33cd2","id":"c6bbd6c8","name":"Breakout - Upstairs Big"},{"original_id":"accf3d0c-094e-4220-8388-b5adf26c8f99","id":"accf3d0c","name":"Breakout - Main Floor"},{"original_id":"e16ec9a4-4a4c-4851-9bf0-7b1f0c703d05","id":"e16ec9a4","name":"Main Room"},{"original_id":"2ad2ca70-564c-4d46-acee-2563d1c299ff","id":"2ad2ca70","name":"Code Lab"},{"original_id":"5faad506-efba-4a61-8789-2b4e1934c2db","id":"5faad506","name":"Breakout - Upstairs Small"}],"tags":[{"category":"THEME","name":"Develop","abstract":"","tag":"THEME_DEVELOP","original_id":"2ade1c01-8ed0-e311-b297-00155d5066d7","order_in_category":2},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_ADVANCED","original_id":"ffc20a9c-212f-4ccb-977c-65bc228e22ed","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_INTRO","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_INTRO","original_id":"a8748600-dd2f-43b4-87d4-7162d250a1d8","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_BLE","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_BLE","original_id":"4dd4523e-b467-4f85-bb26-671df9317172","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"Tools","abstract":"","color":"#607d8b","tag":"TOPIC_TOOLS","original_id":"eea54986-3688-e311-84db-00155d5066d7","order_in_category":13},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"UX","abstract":"","color":"#00897b","tag":"TOPIC_UX","original_id":"f2a54986-3688-e311-84db-00155d5066d7","order_in_category":14},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_HARDWARE","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_HARDWARE","original_id":"f06e2dfe-c6bf-4902-8dcb-c4c0d6cac232","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_KEYNOTE","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_KEYNOTE","original_id":"d4f10ca5-0eed-4b9f-a723-db61a577f5b5","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_BUILD","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_BUILD","original_id":"5a46f3e5-9d19-40c9-9e27-3b58a89d3daf","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_L","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_L","original_id":"35fba6ae-10bd-4f22-8a02-bf7a4eb70167","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_SECURITY","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_SECURITY","original_id":"47e1143a-8f9e-4e08-9c8b-46c68163bca6","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_GEO","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_GEO","original_id":"2c867b4c-0fb8-48f1-a11b-187dfde394db","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_UNJAVA","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_UNJAVA","original_id":"5d6c0ddf-4a93-44a4-9d5c-18320cf5137e","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"Wearables","abstract":"","color":"#ad1457","tag":"TOPIC_WEARABLES","original_id":"a1305602-3788-e311-84db-00155d5066d7","order_in_category":15},{"category":"THEME","name":"THEME_BUSINESS","abstract":"","tag":"THEME_BUSINESS","original_id":"4b38c979-56fa-4a12-ad0e-417068c5912c","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_VIDEO","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_VIDEO","original_id":"f698eb05-a006-4c43-bf04-e27e1aff29b6","order_in_category":0},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_THREADING","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_THREADING","original_id":"0118812f-87c9-4b62-a1cc-8ffd850d18bc","order_in_category":0},{"category":"THEME","name":"Design","abstract":"","tag":"THEME_DESIGN","original_id":"c120fdc1-8dd0-e311-b297-00155d5066d7","order_in_category":1},{"category":"TOPIC","name":"TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE","abstract":"","tag":"TOPIC_BESTPRACTICE","original_id":"7364ec39-7191-47a1-b8f2-5bc898d7148b","order_in_category":0}]}
